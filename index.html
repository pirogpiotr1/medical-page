                        There are a variety of problems with teeth, gums, jawbones
                        and other soft or bony tissue that may require treatment by an
                        oral and maxillofacial surgeon. This type of surgery should only
                        be undertaken after careful consideration and discussion
                        with your surgeon.

                    <p>Orthognathic means straight jaws. Orthognathic surgery is needed when
                        jaws don’t meet correctly and/or teeth don’t seem to fit with jaws.
                        Teeth are straightened with orthodontics and corrective jaw surgery
                        repositions misaligned jaws. This not only improves facial appearance,
                        but also ensures that teeth meet correctly and function properly;
                        hence improving a person’s ability to chew and speak.
